Hello everyone!

Today I made password generator with React. I got this idea from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuaNGOx4ZSc&ab_channel=RAMADHANKHAMIS of Edward Snowden talking about how we should forget using 8 letter passwords that are easy to brute force, and instead use long pass phrases.

Stay safe out there.
